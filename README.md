So now you know what's in your fridge? :beer: :sunglasses:

## TODO

- [x] CLEANING UP!
- [x] Style it up! :fire:
- [ ] Add cool badges to README :star2:

- [ ] Do some cool stuff on the /user page :wheelchair:

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

node ./src/server
```
